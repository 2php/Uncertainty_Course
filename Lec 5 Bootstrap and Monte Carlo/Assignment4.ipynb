    "(3 point) In order to determine that there is significant evidence at 98% level of confidence that the mean calcium level of two types of products differ by more than 5 units, independent analysis of these two products was done. 20 samples of the first products were tested and the following results were obtained: mean = 21.3 and standard deviation = 1.8. 15 samples of the second product were tested with the mean of 14.2 and standard deviation of 2.4. Measurements of both products follow normal distribution. <br>\n",
    "To determine that one product has higher calcium level then the other at 98% confidence level is the same as determining if confidence intervals of difference of the means of the concentration levels of two products does not include value 5 at 98% level. Compute confidence level of the difference using the hint below and comment on if the difference is significant or not.\n",

    "Hint: In one of the previous assignments, you worked on obtaining the mean and standard deviation of the sum of two random variables. In this example, we are looking at the difference between two random variables and we are trying to compute the confidence intervals of the difference. This is very important problem in statistics where it is important to observe if the data generated using new method/process/medicine significantly differ from the data generated using a traditional way. You know that the difference of two Gaussian random variables is also a random variable. Therefore use a formula that we had in the class for computing confidence intervals for the normal random variable but replace the mean and the variance with the mean and the variance of the difference of the random variables from the assignment #2. Please also note that both standard deviations need to be scaled with $\\sqrt(n_1)$ and $\\sqrt(n_2)$ respectively.   <br>\n"
