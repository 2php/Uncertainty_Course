    "## Problem 3 - Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Literature review need to include the analysis of minimum 3 research papers that are related to the concepts that we statied until now but applied to the theory of measurements, measurement errors, modeling engineering/scientific/medical systems. You can find papers on Google scholar. Examples of topics include: hierarchical models and their use for modeling measurement errors, system/instrument/devices that are modeled using Gaussian processes, Bayesian models and their callibration, Bayesian machine learning and applications for measurement errors, smart metrology and so on. Literature review should not include only what other researcher did but also how this compares to other works and how is this related to the concepts covered in our course. Please submit your work in IEEE format for conferences in Latex https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html or as a notebook. If you would like to get feedback on your topic before writing please contact me. "
